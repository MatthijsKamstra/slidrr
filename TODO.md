- bullit list animated
- host files on dropbox
- presentation mode
- all in on file (html/min-css/min-js) via grunt?
- images as big as possible but not full screen
- split is very precise : `--` works `-- ` doesn't
- first thing is a image
	- show images fullscreen `cover` or `contain`
	- add `?` to the end of the url and it is `contain`

# FIX

```
Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.
```



# DONE

### fullscreen image hack

- use alt text for image, to change background color
	- use this value to change the text on top of it
	- use glow for more contrast
